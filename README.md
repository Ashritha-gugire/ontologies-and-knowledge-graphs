*****Ontology and Knowledge Graphs for Wines Data*****

This is a simple project, which involves the creation and analysis of an ontology and knowledge graph specifically designed for the wine domain. 
The notebook Ontology_KG_Wines.ipynb contains the complete workflow, including data preparation, and knowledge graph visualization.

**Project Description** 
The main goal of this simple project is to create a knowledge graph for wines, enabling better organization, querying, and analysis of wine-related data. 
The project covers the following aspects:
1.Data collection and preparation
2.Knowledge graph construction.

This is our sample ontology

Accordingly: 
Data Collection: The project involves gathering wine-related data from various sources, including wine attributes, types, regions, and production details.
Data Preparation: The collected data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is in a suitable format for ontology creation and knowledge graph construction.
Ontology Design: An ontology is designed to define the structure and relationships of different wine-related entities, such as grape varieties, wine types, regions, producers, and tasting notes.
Ontology Creation: Using the prepared data, the ontology is created, establishing the hierarchical and associative relationships between various wine-related entities.
Knowledge Graph Construction: The ontology is used to construct a knowledge graph that visually and logically represents the relationships between the wine-related entities.
